* Bordle

Hi, I'm Bryan and this is my version of wordle, bordle.  It is text-only.  It defaults to 5-letter words and 6 guesses like wordle, but you can also specify any size word and any number of guesses.  Words are chosen from =/usr/share/dict/words=.  Run:

#+begin_src sh
  ./bordle.py --help
#+end_src

To see the options, or to run it like plain wordle, just run:

#+begin_src sh
  ./bordle.py
#+end_src
